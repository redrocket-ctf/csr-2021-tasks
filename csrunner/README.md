## Description
Unity game with linux + windows builds. It's a "racing" game where you have to collect green orbs (pieces of the flag) while avoiding enemies that run towards you. The game is compiled using IL2CPP (so "native" code instead of IL) and uses an integrated simple library to read the flag from a resource file. The flag itself is encoded in the lower two bits per byte in the resource file (which is a meme image). 

## CTF Description
Collect green stuff, avoid red guys. Easy as pie, right? Not even your speedhacks will help you here! You might have to take a closer look and _inspect_ it carefully. Have fun & good luck!
