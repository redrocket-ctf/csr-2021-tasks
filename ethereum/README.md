Unknown Origin/Unaffordable
=============

## Description

1. *UnknownOrigin*: Beginner ETH Smart Contract challenge, deploy a smart contract to call the updateOwner function while fulfilling the condition of the onlyOwned modifier.
2. *Unaffordable*: This challenge is solved by exploiting an issue where the create2 can be used to replace bytecode on a deployed contract 
3. *FollowTheLeader*: Very easy with source code but this is not provided, bytecode will need to be decompiled to find the solution

## CTF Description

1. *UnknownOrigin*: It's not always about where you're going, sometimes it's about where you're coming from.
2. *Unaffordable*:  Who doesn't want to own a contract worth 1,000,000 Ether? To beat his level you need to take ownership of the contract. Don't think its worth spending 1M Ether? Maybe there is another way...
3. *FollowTheLeader*: The goal is to set a new high score, and take the lead. How hard can it be? No source code? No problem...
